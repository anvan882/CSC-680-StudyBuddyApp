# 📚 StudyBuddy

**StudyBuddy** is a lightweight iOS productivity app built with **SwiftUI** that helps students track assignments, set goals, and stay organized during their academic journey. This app is designed to be simple, intuitive, and fast — perfect for students who need a no-fuss way to manage tasks.

## 🧾 Proposal

This section outlines the proposed features categorized by priority. This helps guide the team during implementation and makes it easy to identify minimum viable functionality vs enhancements.

### ✅ Must-Have Features (Core Functionality)
These are the **required features** to meet the project’s goals and deliver a working MVP:
- Add, edit, and delete study subjects
- Track long-term and daily study goals
- Mark weekly progress (7-day tracker)
- Save user progress to Firestore (e.g., goals, streak, rewards)
- Sign in anonymously per device for personal goal tracking
- Navigation across Home, Session, Goals, and Settings screens
- To be easy, simple and quick to use

### 🌟 Nice-to-Have Features (Future Enhancements)
These are **not essential** to the MVP, but would greatly improve UX:
- Weekly streak auto-reset on Sundays using Cloud Functions
- Push notifications when a streak is completed
- Quote of the Day rotation
- Export or share completed goals
- In-app animations or reward confetti
- Personalization (change theme colors, font sizes)
- Auto backup or syncing across multiple devices (with real auth)
- Detailed usage insights or analytics dashboard (time spent per subject)
